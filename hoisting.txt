Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior in which a function or a variable can be used before declaration. 

Variable Hoisting -
In terms of variables and constants, keyword var is hoisted and let and const does not allow hoisting.
Also, when the variable is used inside the function, the variable is hoisted only to the top of the function.

Function Hoisting - 
A function can be called before declaring it.
However, when a function is used as an expression, an error occurs because only declarations are hoisted.
